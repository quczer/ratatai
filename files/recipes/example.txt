Here’s a quick recipe for Gordon Ramsay’s scrambled eggs:

Ingredients:

    4 eggs
    1 tbsp butter
    Salt and pepper to taste
    1 tbsp cream (optional, for creaminess)
    Fresh herbs (optional, like chives or parsley)

Instructions:

    Crack the eggs into a bowl, whisk gently until well combined.
    Heat a non-stick pan on medium-low, add butter and let it melt.
    Pour in the eggs, stir gently with a spatula, moving them around the pan. Remove from heat occasionally to avoid overcooking.
    Add cream for extra creaminess (optional).
    Season with salt and pepper, and garnish with fresh herbs.
